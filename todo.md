# BetterTrade Technical Assessment Plan

- [x] Collect and review high-level architecture documentation (markdown files in project root)
- [x] Assess Agent Architecture: identify multi-agent modules and inter-canister communication patterns
- [x] Evaluate data flow and state management across agents
- [x] Analyze error handling, recovery mechanisms, and resilience in agent components
- [x] Review event-driven architecture implementation in shared logging/metrics
- [x] Assess Bitcoin Integration Architecture: review t-ECDSA design and security model
- [x] Evaluate Bitcoin transaction construction and UTXO management approach
- [x] Analyze network integration patterns and confirmation-tracking design
- [x] Review abstraction layers between ICP Bitcoin API and application logic
- [x] Assess Frontend Architecture: review React/TypeScript component patterns and folder structure
- [x] Evaluate state management and service layer design (contexts and services)
- [ ] Assess wallet integration approach and user experience flow
- [x] Review notification system and real-time data handling architecture
- [ ] Assess System Integration & Scalability: review inter-canister design for bottlenecks
- [ ] Evaluate data persistence strategies and stable memory usage
- [ ] Assess deployment architecture and upgrade mechanisms (dfx, scripts, docs)
- [ ] Review monitoring, logging, and observability approaches
- [ ] Assess Security Architecture: evaluate auth/authz and access control patterns
- [ ] Assess cryptographic implementations, key management, and trust boundaries
- [ ] Review input validation, sanitization, and attack surface considerations
- [ ] Assess Production Readiness: code quality, maintainability, and testing practices
