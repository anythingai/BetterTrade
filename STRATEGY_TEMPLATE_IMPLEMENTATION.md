# Strategy Template System Implementation Summary

## Task 4.1: Create strategy template system - COMPLETED

### 1. Strategy Template Data Structures ✅

- Defined in `src/shared/types.mo` as `StrategyTemplate` type
- Includes: id, name, risk_level, venues, est_apy_band, params_schema
- Supports Conservative, Balanced, and Aggressive risk levels

### 2. Predefined Strategy Catalog ✅

Enhanced catalog with 6 comprehensive strategies:

**Conservative Strategies:**

- Conservative Bitcoin Lending (3-6% APY, 4 venues)
- Conservative Bitcoin Staking (2.5-5% APY, 3 venues)

**Balanced Strategies:**

- Balanced Liquidity Provision (8-15% APY, 4 venues)
- Balanced DeFi Strategies (6-12% APY, 3 venues)

**Aggressive Strategies:**

- Aggressive Yield Farming (15-35% APY, 4 venues)
- Aggressive Trading Strategies (20-50% APY, 3 venues)

### 3. Strategy Scoring Algorithm ✅

Enhanced scoring system with:

- **Configurable weights**: APY (40%), Risk (35%), Liquidity (25%)
- **Detailed breakdown**: Returns component scores for transparency
- **Risk alignment scoring**: Perfect matches score 1.0, mismatches score lower
- **Market conditions integration**: APY, risk, and liquidity factors
- **Score normalization**: All scores bounded between 0.0 and 1.0

### 4. Strategy Template Management Methods ✅

New public methods added:

- `list_strategies()`: Get all available strategies
- `get_strategy(id)`: Get specific strategy by ID
- `list_strategies_by_risk(risk_level)`: Filter strategies by risk level
- `get_scoring_weights()`: Get current scoring configuration
- `update_scoring_weights()`: Update scoring weights with validation
- `test_strategy_scoring()`: Test scoring algorithm for debugging

### 5. Enhanced Unit Tests ✅

Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases:

1. Strategy template creation validation
2. Strategy scoring algorithm testing
3. Rationale generation verification
4. Strategy catalog completeness check
5. Scoring weights validation
6. Strategy filtering by risk level
7. Enhanced scoring with breakdown
8. Comprehensive catalog testing

### 6. Enhanced Rationale Generation ✅

Detailed explanations including:

- Risk profile alignment explanation
- APY range and venue information
- Score breakdown (APY, Risk, Liquidity components)
- Specific recommendations based on risk alignment

## Key Features Implemented

### Scoring Algorithm Details

```motoko
score = (0.4 * apy_score) + (0.35 * risk_score) + (0.25 * liquidity_score)
```

### Risk Alignment Matrix

- Perfect matches (Conservative-Conservative): 1.0
- Good matches (Balanced-Conservative): 0.7
- Moderate matches (Conservative-Balanced): 0.6
- Poor matches (Conservative-Aggressive): 0.2

### Market Conditions Integration

- APY Factor: Adjusts for market APY conditions
- Risk Factor: Adjusts for market volatility
- Liquidity Factor: Adjusts for market liquidity

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ Requirements 2.2: Strategy recommendation based on risk profile
- ✅ Requirements 2.3: Strategy scoring and selection algorithm
- ✅ All unit tests pass validation
- ✅ Configurable scoring weights with validation
- ✅ Comprehensive strategy catalog covering all risk levels
- ✅ Transparent and explainable recommendations

## Next Steps

Task 4.1 is complete. Ready to proceed to Task 4.2: Implement recommendation engine.
