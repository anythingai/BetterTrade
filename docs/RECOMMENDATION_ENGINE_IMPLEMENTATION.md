# Recommendation Engine Implementation Summary

## Task 4.2: Implement recommendation engine ✅ COMPLETED

### Requirements Addressed

**Requirements 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 7.2:**

- ✅ Risk profile to strategy mapping logic
- ✅ Strategy scoring with APY, risk, and liquidity factors  
- ✅ Explainable recommendation with rationale generation
- ✅ Transparent decision-making processes

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Risk Profile to Strategy Mapping Logic ✅

**Location:** `src/strategy_selector/main.mo` - `calculate_strategy_score()` function

**Implementation:**

- Risk alignment scoring matrix for all combinations of user risk vs strategy risk
- Perfect matches (conservative-conservative, balanced-balanced, aggressive-aggressive) score 1.0
- Partial matches score between 0.3-0.7 based on compatibility
- Mismatches (conservative-aggressive) score 0.2-0.3

```motoko
let risk_alignment = switch (user_risk, strategy.risk_level) {
    case (#conservative, #conservative) { 1.0 };
    case (#balanced, #balanced) { 1.0 };
    case (#aggressive, #aggressive) { 1.0 };
    case (#conservative, #balanced) { 0.6 };
    // ... additional mappings
};
```

#### 2. Strategy Scoring with APY, Risk, and Liquidity Factors ✅

**Location:** `src/strategy_selector/main.mo` - `calculate_strategy_score()` function

**Scoring Algorithm:**

- **APY Score (40% weight):** Normalized APY against 50% maximum
- **Risk Score (35% weight):** Risk alignment × (1 - market risk factor)
- **Liquidity Score (25% weight):** Based on venue count (max 5 venues = 1.0 score)

**Configurable Weights:**

```motoko
private stable var scoring_weights = {
    apy_weight = 0.4;
    risk_weight = 0.35;
    liquidity_weight = 0.25;
};
```

**Market Conditions Integration:**

- APY factor: Adjusts for current market APY conditions
- Risk factor: Adjusts for current market volatility
- Liquidity factor: Adjusts for current market liquidity

#### 3. Explainable Recommendation with Rationale Generation ✅

**Location:** `src/strategy_selector/main.mo` - `generate_rationale()` function

**Rationale Components:**

- User risk profile explanation
- Expected APY range
- Available venues and count
- Overall score out of 100
- Score breakdown (APY, Risk, Liquidity percentages)
- Risk alignment explanation specific to user-strategy combination

**Example Rationale:**

```
"Recommended for your conservative risk profile. Expected APY: 3.0% - 6.0%. 
Available on 4 venues: BlockFi, Celsius, Nexo, Ledn. Overall score: 85.0/100. 
Score breakdown - APY: 12.0%, Risk alignment: 85.0%, Liquidity: 60.0%. 
Perfect match for conservative investors seeking capital preservation."
```

#### 4. Core Recommendation Engine Methods ✅

**Main Recommendation Method:**

```motoko
public shared(msg) func recommend(uid: Types.UserId, risk: Types.RiskLevel) : async Types.Result<Types.StrategyPlan, Types.ApiError>
```

- Scores all available strategies for user's risk profile
- Returns top-scoring strategy as a complete StrategyPlan
- Includes allocations across strategy venues
- Sets plan status to #pending for user approval

**Multiple Recommendations Method:**

```motoko
public shared(msg) func get_recommendations(uid: Types.UserId, risk: Types.RiskLevel, limit: ?Nat) : async Types.Result<[...], Types.ApiError>
```

- Returns top N recommendations with scores and rationales
- Useful for showing alternatives to users
- Includes detailed scoring breakdown for transparency

#### 5. Strategy Plan Creation and Management ✅

**Plan Generation:**

- Unique plan IDs with timestamp and user identification
- Equal allocation across strategy venues by default
- Proper percentage calculations (sum to 100%)
- Rationale included for transparency

**Plan Approval Workflow:**

```motoko
public shared(msg) func accept_plan(uid: Types.UserId, plan_id: Types.PlanId) : async Types.Result<Bool, Types.ApiError>
```

- User authorization verification
- Status transition from #pending to #approved
- Plan locking mechanism

#### 6. Transparency and Auditability ✅

**Decision Transparency:**

- All scoring factors exposed in breakdown
- Rationale explains decision reasoning
- Market conditions factored into scoring
- Configurable weights for different priorities

**Query Methods for Transparency:**

- `test_strategy_scoring()` - Debug method to test scoring for any strategy-risk combination
- `get_scoring_weights()` - View current scoring configuration
- `get_user_plans()` - View all plans for a user
- `get_plans_by_status()` - Query plans by status

### Testing Implementation ✅

**Test Coverage:**

- `tests/recommendation_engine_test.mo` - Comprehensive test suite
- Conservative, balanced, and aggressive recommendation accuracy
- Strategy plan creation and approval workflow
- Scoring consistency and rationale quality
- Allocation distribution validation
- Recommendation ranking verification

**Validation Script:**

- `validate_recommendation_engine.mo` - Standalone validation
- Data structure validation
- Risk profile mapping verification
- Full integration testing

### Integration Points ✅

**Inter-Canister Communication Ready:**

- Implements `Interfaces.StrategySelectorInterface`
- Returns proper `Types.Result<T, Types.ApiError>` for error handling
- Plan IDs designed for execution agent integration
- User ID validation for security

**Portfolio Integration Ready:**

- Plan allocations include venue IDs and amounts
- Percentage-based allocation for flexible portfolio sizes
- Status tracking for execution workflow

### Performance Considerations ✅

**Efficient Scoring:**

- O(n) complexity for scoring all strategies
- Configurable result limits to prevent large responses
- Stable memory for upgrade persistence

**Caching Strategy:**

- Market conditions cached to avoid repeated calculations
- Strategy templates cached in HashMap for fast access
- Scoring weights configurable without redeployment
