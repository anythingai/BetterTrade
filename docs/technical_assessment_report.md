## 2. Detailed Findings

### 2.1 Agent Architecture & Communication  
**Strengths:** Multi-agent modularity with `AgentCommunicator`, audit trails for inter-canister calls.  
**Risks:** Synchronous call bottlenecks, logging latency.  
**Recommendations:** Enable parallel inter-canister calls, offload audit logging.

### 2.2 Data Flow & State Management  
**Strengths:** Clear separation of concerns, hash map usage for runtime state.  
**Risks:** In-memory buffers unbounded, lack of stable compaction.  
**Recommendations:** Implement buffer eviction policies, streaming logs.

### 2.3 Error Handling & Resilience  
**Strengths:** Consistent `Result` patterns, audit logging of failures.  
**Risks:** Generic internal errors lose context, repetitive catch/translate code.  
**Recommendations:** Centralize error wrapping, preserve original error details.

### 2.4 Event-Driven Architecture & Logging  
**Strengths:** Event bus with subscribers, structured `Logger` and `MetricsCollector`.  
**Risks:** Sequential subscriber dispatch, lack of persistence for logs/metrics.  
**Recommendations:** Dispatch events asynchronously, expose logs/metrics via HTTP API.

### 2.5 Bitcoin Integration & Transaction Handling  
**Strengths:** End-to-end mock transaction flow: builder, signer, broadcaster, polling.  
**Risks:** Placeholder cryptography, naive address and DER implementations.  
**Recommendations:** Integrate real t-ECDSA management canister, robust signature libraries.

### 2.6 System Integration & Scalability  
**Strengths:** Dependency-ordered canister calls, execution flow tracking.  
**Risks:** Monolithic flows, no concurrency controls, large state copy on upgrade.  
**Recommendations:** Shard flows, add concurrency limits, incremental stable migrations.

### 2.7 Data Persistence & Upgrades  
**Strengths:** Standard `preupgrade`/`postupgrade` snapshot for stable vars.  
**Risks:** Full dataset copy per upgrade, potential instruction/gas limits.  
**Recommendations:** Implement chunked or streaming migration, state compaction.

### 2.8 Deployment & Configuration Management  
**Strengths:** `dfx.json` defines environments, shell scripts for reproducible deploy.  
**Risks:** Manual config propagation, missing automated environment wiring.  
**Recommendations:** Automate `Config.setEnvironment` and `updateCanisterConfig` in CI scripts.

### 2.9 Observability & Debugging  
**Strengths:** In-memory logs and metrics, debug prints for development.  
**Risks:** No external scrape endpoints, log loss on canister restart.  
**Recommendations:** Persist logs in a dedicated canister, expose metrics for Prometheus.

### 2.10 Security & Access Control  
**Strengths:** Principal-based auth, per-method caller checks.  
**Risks:** Open query methods expose data, minimal input sanitization.  
**Recommendations:** Implement ACL, restrict admin APIs, strengthen validation.

### 2.11 Input Validation & Sanitization  
**Strengths:** Basic length and prefix checks on Bitcoin addresses and display names.  
**Risks:** No checksum validation, ad-hoc JSON parsing, injection risk.  
**Recommendations:** Use standard address validation libraries, proper JSON parsers.

### 2.12 Production Readiness & Testing Practices  
**Strengths:** Well-covered frontend unit tests, ESLint/TypeScript quality gates.  
**Risks:** No backend Motoko tests or CI integration, missing e2e tests.  
**Recommendations:** Add Motoko test harness, CI pipeline with dfx integration and E2E tests.

### 2.13 Performance & Optimization  
**Strengths:** Simplified MVP flow, clear code paths.  
**Risks:** Frequent allocations, synchronous loops, unbounded buffers.  
**Recommendations:** Optimize buffer usage, parallelize operations, add cycle budgeting.

## 3. Overall Risk Profile & Next Steps

**Overall Assessment:**  
BetterTrade exhibits solid modular design and frontend quality, but requires enhancements in backend cryptography, observability, and performance for production readiness.

**Key Risks:**  
- State upgrade limits  
- Open query surfaces  
- Placeholder cryptography  

**Next Steps:**  
- Implement CI/CD  
- Integrate real Bitcoin and crypto APIs  
- Strengthen security and observability  
- Optimize performance
